# Marvel-Ultimate-War
Marvel: Ultimate War is a 2-player battle game where each player selects 3 champions to form their team and engage in combat with the opponent's team. Players take turns attacking each other's champions until one player defeats all of the opposing champions, declaring them the winner of the battle. Battles occur on a 5x5 grid, with each grid cell being empty or occupied by a champion or obstacle/cover. Players strategically utilize their champions' normal attacks and special abilities to outmaneuver and overcome their opponents. The teams begin the battle positioned at opposite sides/edges of the grid.
